# Home Manager

It is a small management system, which can store some of your private data.
The main idea is that, if you are little bit paranoic as me, you will never store any of your private data anywhere except your own trusted place.

Used technologies and libraries:
	c# .Net 4.5
	Ms Sql
	EntityFramework
	Structuremap

	angular 1.4.8
	bootstrap 3.2.0
	lodash
	highcharts 4.0.1
	text-angular 1.4.6
	less

Project requirements:
	.Net 4.5
	IIS 7+
	Ms Sql Server 

Quick start guide:

	- clone it
	- update connectionString in the web.config with the correct settings
	- start the project with IIS Express (maybe you will need to copy some dll's to bin folder manually)
	- use default login credentials (Admin/AcrossTheUniverse) to create your customer, (admin has some restrictions)
	- create some categories in the settings tab
	- it seems it is all. Good Luck
